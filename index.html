    <h1>BENEATH</h1>
    <p>THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. UNDER THE HARD CRACKED SKULL, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. NO LIGHT PENETRATES, NO SOUND ESCAPES, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. FLESH PEELS BACK, LAYERS OF SKIN TURN TO DUST, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. INSIDE, A SWAMP OF DECAY, BLACK SLIME FEEDS ON THE REMAINS, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. SILENT, EMPTY, VOID OF LIFE, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. OPEN IT WIDE, TEAR THROUGH THE CRACKS, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. NERVES FRAYED, CELLS COLLAPSE, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. THINKING DIED LONG AGO, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. NO MEMORY, NO DREAMS, ONLY THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. GRAY MATTER MELTS LIKE CANDLE WAX, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. LIQUID BLACKNESS SWIRLS, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. THE SMELL OF DEATH, THE TASTE OF SILENCE, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. IT TWISTS, IT BREAKS, IT FADES, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. NO SOUL INSIDE, NO HOPE, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. FLESH FALLS AWAY, BONES SNAP, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. EMPTY SOCKETS WATCH, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. REPEAT IT, WHISPER IT, SCREAM IT — THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. DEEPER AND DEEPER, INTO THE VOID, THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. THE BRAIN IS ROTTING. THE BRAIN IS ROTTING.</p>
